\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have presented  a new approach for QoS provisioning in residential and small business networks. The overall idea is to identify each traffic crossing the access router and rate limiting some traffic, pertaining to a particular application class, according to a user configuration. It aims to simplify network management and configuration, and enhance its performance. 
We showed that our initial evaluation results are very promising because  OpenFlow delivers the flexibility necessary to provide adequate service for the end-users.  We are continuing the implementation of some new features, with focus on exploring other approaches to network traffic classification and combine them with the one we are suing in this work. This will make the classification more accurate.
