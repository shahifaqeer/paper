\section{Observations}

We made some observations during preliminary measurements of home network devices in our testbed. We use these observations to develop bottleneck detection algorithms.
\begin{itemize}
\item Comparing TCP bandwidth over the wireless home link and the access link will indicate the bottleneck link observable when a new flow is started between end hosts.
\item An end to end large TCP flows cause longer delays in the tighter bottleneck link than the non bottleneck one.
\item For two wireless devices A and B, if the available bandwidth in one direction, BA is greater than the other, AB, then the sender device for the better measurement direction has a better channel to the router than the other device, i.e. B to gateway is better than A to gateway if BA > AB.
\item Delays caused by 802.11 medium access control are lower than buffering delays caused due to wireless bottlenecks.
\end{itemize}
